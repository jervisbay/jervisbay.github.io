# Unit 01 Homework

For this homework, I did the following things:

1.  Inserted comments on both the html file and css file to give the reader a clearer sense of the functions of each block of code
2.  Added alt tags to every image in the html file
3.  Eliminated duplication of classes / IDs in the css and html file such that one class can be repeated for different blocks of code
4.  Accessibility score was 91 on audit
