### Homework 5 - Work Day Scheduler

## Your Daily Nine to Five Schedule

This is a web application that organizes a user's daily nine to five schedule into hourly blocks.

User enters an event / todo into the appropriate hourly time slot.

Once entered, the field will be highlighted in green and a button will be created to allow user to clear the event / todo once it is completed.

User can edit prior entries and a helpful note will be created to let the user know that the entry was edited as well as when it was edited.

When the day is over or if the user wishes to start afresh, click on the "Start New Day" button.
